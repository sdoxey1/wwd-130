    <h2>Sam</h2>
    <p>My name is Sam Doxey and I am from Hillsboro Oregon which is very close to Portland Oregon. I have been at Byui for over two years and most of that online. I have worked and done online school for a while so my semesters are messed up. I am not exaclty sure what I want to major in, but I know i want to be in the health field. My favorite things to do are eating, reading, and watching tv. I love Indian and Thai food. 
      <p>I am taking this course as an elective to see if I like web design. So far I have enjoyed what we have leared so far. Hope we can all have a great semester.</p>
